📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Customer Churn Data
📌 Overview
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of customer churn data. The goal of this analysis is to understand patterns in customer behavior, identify factors contributing to churn, and generate insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

📂 Dataset
Source: Kaggle
Description: The dataset contains customer details, subscription types, and service usage patterns.
Key Features Analyzed:
Phone and internet services
Security and backup options
Streaming services
Customer tenure and contract type
Monthly charges and total charges

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

🚢 Data Wrangling on the Titanic Dataset
📌 Overview
This repository contains data wrangling and preprocessing performed on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to clean and prepare the data for further analysis and modeling by handling missing values, transforming features, and ensuring data consistency.

📂 Dataset
Source: Seaborn
Description: The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including demographics, ticket details, and survival status.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

🏗️ Data Wrangling Steps
Handling Missing Values

Identified missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
Imputed missing values using appropriate strategies (e.g., median for Age, mode for Embarked)
Feature Engineering & Transformation

Extracted titles from passenger names
Created family size feature
Converted categorical variables into numerical format
Outlier Detection & Handling

Used boxplots and IQR method to detect outliers in Fare and Age
Handled outliers by capping extreme values
Data Normalization & Encoding

Encoded categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding
Scaled numerical features for better model performance

📊 Key Insights
Higher survival rates observed in women and children
First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival probability
Passengers with smaller ticket numbers (lower fare) were more likely to be in lower classes
